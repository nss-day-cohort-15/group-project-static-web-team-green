We have a fantastic little sky! I really recommend you use odorless thinner or your spouse is gonna run you right out into the yard and you'll be working by yourself. Working it up and down, back and forth. Now we can begin working on lots of happy little things.</p>

              <p>Pretend you're water. Just floating without any effort. Having a good day. Maybe we got a few little happy bushes here, just covered with snow. We want to use a lot pressure while using no pressure at all. If you've been in Alaska less than a year you're a Cheechako. Let's put some happy little bushes on the other side now. You can work and carry-on and put lots of little happy things in here.</p>
              <p>And I will hypnotize that just a little bit. I guess that would be considered a UFO. A big cotton ball in the sky. Let's have a little bit of fun today. We can fix anything. It's a very cold picture, I may have to go get my coat. It’s about to freeze me to death. In this world, everything can be happy.</p>
              <p>Work that paint. Nothing's gonna make your husband or wife madder than coming home and having a snow-covered dinner. I'm a water fanatic. I love water. Be careful. You can always add more - but you can't take it away. Do an almighty painting with us. Brown is such a nice color.</p>
